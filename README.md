# Credit Card Fraud Detection

Welcome to the **Credit Card Fraud Detection** repository! This project focuses on utilizing machine learning techniques to build a model that detects fraudulent credit card transactions. The project employs a Logistic Regression model to achieve accurate fraud detection.

## Project Overview

In this project, we tackle the challenge of identifying fraudulent credit card transactions within a dataset. Credit card fraud is a significant concern, and using machine learning to detect suspicious activities can help financial institutions prevent potential losses. The dataset used for this project, "creditcard.csv," contains a mix of legitimate and fraudulent transactions. By training a model on this dataset, we aim to develop a tool that can identify fraudulent transactions effectively.

## Project Structure

The repository comprises the following key components:

- `creditcard.csv`: This CSV file contains the dataset used for training and testing the fraud detection model. It includes various features related to credit card transactions, along with a "Class" column indicating whether the transaction is legitimate (0) or fraudulent (1).

- `main.py`: This Python script contains the code for loading the dataset, preprocessing the data, training a Logistic Regression model, and making predictions. It also calculates the accuracy of the model's predictions and showcases an example prediction using custom input data.

- `README.md`: This README file provides an overview of the project, its objectives, and instructions for running the code. It explains the dataset, the approach taken to build the fraud detection model, and how to interpret the results.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Make sure you have Python and the required libraries installed (NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn).
3. Run the `main.py` script using a Python interpreter. This script will load and preprocess the data, train the Logistic Regression model, display the accuracy of the model's predictions, and showcase an example prediction using custom input data.

## Results

Upon running the script, you will see the accuracy of the model's predictions on the testing data. The script also includes an example prediction using custom input data, demonstrating how the model can determine whether a transaction is legitimate or fraudulent.

## Note

This project serves as an illustrative example of using machine learning for credit card fraud detection. Keep in mind that real-world fraud detection systems are more complex and involve various techniques beyond the scope of this project. You can further enhance the project by experimenting with different algorithms, fine-tuning hyperparameters, and exploring additional fraud detection techniques.

Feel free to explore the code, run the example, and contribute to the project by improving the model's accuracy or implementing more advanced fraud detection strategies.
